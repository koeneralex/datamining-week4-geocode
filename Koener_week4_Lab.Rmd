# Instructions

> **Warning: Do not copy and paste any code I give out here. You MUST write them up.** 
**If you copy and paste code from here to your RStudio, you will receive errors.** 

In Chapter 13 we explored how to use “mashup” data to create a map and put additional 
data “on top of” the map. In this assignment, we will do that, but with one 
additional requirement to “zoom” into the region of the United States where the
data is of interest.

First, read in the dataset `crimeInSYR.csv` (in the project's data folder). 
The column show the type of crime, the address of the crime, the city of the crime, 
and the date of the crime. As you can guess from the title of the data file, 
the focus of the dataset is crimes around the Syracuse, NY area.

For this assignment, you need to create two different, but related, maps: 
A map with “points” for each of the crimes, and a “density map” showing the same information.

Install the "ggplot2" and "ggmap" packages as needed, and load the two packages
in the setup code chunk below.

---

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
# Add your library below.

library(ggplot2)      # For graphing
library(ggmap)        # For mapping
library(tidyverse)    # For data munging
library(dplyr)

```

# Step 1 - A map with “points” for each of the crimes

## Step 1.1 - Read the data
1. Read in `crimeInSYR.csv` and save it as an object.
2. Investigate the data structure. 

```{r, "Step 1.1"}
# Write your code below.

mydata <- read.csv("data/crimeInSYR.csv")
workingDF <- mydata

```

## Step 1.2 - Clean the data
1. Change the column names to ("type", "address", "city", "date")
2. Combine the `address` column and `city` column together and store the values 
into a new column called `address_complete`

## Step 1.3 - Get your Google API Key
1. You need a Google API key for the next step, which uses the `geocode()` function. 
Google API requires you to register your  credit  card  information.
    - To get the API key, follow the directions:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key
    - If you already have Google API key, go to 
https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/api-list?project=uber-kmeans-1549390594743
      - Then click "Geocoding API" and enable it.
      - Go back a page, click "CREDENTIAL" in the left navigation bar
      - Retrieve your google API key.
      - Enter your API key in the `register_google()` function below.
      
```{r, "Step 1.3", echo = FALSE}
# Your API key will not display on your homework because `echo = FALSE`.

# Rename columns by creating new ones.
workingDF$type <- workingDF$Aggravated.assault
workingDF$address <- workingDF$X800.block.Avery.Av
workingDF$city <- workingDF$Syracuse
workingDF$date <- workingDF$X12.20.15

# Remove old columns.
workingDF$Aggravated.assault <- NULL
workingDF$X800.block.Avery.Av <- NULL
workingDF$Syracuse <- NULL
workingDF$X12.20.15 <- NULL

# New column for complete address.
workingDF$address_complete <- paste(workingDF$address, workingDF$city, sep=" ")

# Setup geocode.
register_google(key <-"AIzaSyCcVJI9E2qpf1w0orBSERlpk3k1agWY4tY")

# Geocode test.
latlon_tampa <- geocode("tampa, fl")

``` 

## Step 1.4 - Get Latitudes and Longitudes
1. Get latitudes and longitudes for all address in the crime dataset and store them 
in a new column using the `geocode()` function.
2. Make sure the new dataframe includes `lon` and `lat` columns.
3. Investigate the structure. 

It should look like this at this point:

![Step 1.4 Environment](data/week4lab1.PNG)

```{r, "Step 1.4"}
# Write your code below.

# Request longitudes and latitudes of addresses from google maps.
lonlats <- geocode(workingDF$address_complete)

# New columns with longitudes and latitudes.
workingDF$lon <- lonlats$lon
workingDF$lat <- lonlats$lat

```

## Step 1.5 - Create mapSimple object

Use the following code to create an object called `mapSimple`:

```
#get latitude and longtitude for syracuse university
syr <-geocode ("syracuse university, syracuse, ny")
syr

# obtain maps from multiple sources and zoom into the region around syracuse university
syr.map <-get_map(location=syr, zoom=11)

# generate map and sore it in "mapSimple"
mapSimple <- ggmap(syr.map)
# plot the map
mapSimple
```

```{r, "Step 1.5"}
# Write your code below.

# Get latitude and longitude for syracuse university.
syr <-geocode ("syracuse university, syracuse, ny")
syr

# Obtain maps from multiple sources and zoom into the region around syracuse university.
syr.map <-get_map(syr, zoom=11)

# Generate map and store it in "mapSimple".
mapSimple <- ggmap(syr.map)

# Plot the map.
mapSimple

```

## Step 1.6 - Create crimemape

Create an object called `crimemap` based on `mapSimple`, where each point 
represents one crime.

It should look like this:

![Step 1.6 Map](data/week4lab2.PNG)

```{r, "Step 1.6"}
# Write your code below.

crimemap <- mapSimple
crimemap <- crimemap + geom_point(data=workingDF, aes(x=lon, y=lat))
crimemap <- crimemap + ggtitle("Syracuse Crime")
crimemap

```

---

# Step 2 - A “density map” showing the same information.

Use the `geom_density2d()` function. See the documentation as well as the 
ggplot cheatsheet to acquire more information on this. 

The plot should look like this:

![Step 2 Map](data/week4lab3.PNG)

```{r, "Step 2"}
# Write your code below.

densityMap <- mapSimple
densityMap <- densityMap + geom_density2d(mapping=aes(x=lon, y=lat), data=workingDF)
densityMap <- densityMap + ggtitle("Syracuse Crime")
densityMap

```
